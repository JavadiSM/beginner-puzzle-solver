# Beginner Puzzle Solver

## About
This repository aims to implement various search algorithms to solve the NP-hard puzzle problem. The objective is to learn these algorithms and compare their performance practically.

## Algorithms Implemented
| Algorithm                     | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**| Explores all neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving deeper, ensuring the shortest path but using more memory. |
| **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  | Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, conserving memory but not guaranteeing the shortest path. |
| **Depth-Limited Search**      | A variant of DFS that restricts the depth of exploration to avoid infinite paths.               |
| **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)** | Combines the depth efficiency of DFS with the completeness of BFS by incrementally increasing the depth limit. |

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JavadiSM/puzzle-solver
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd puzzle-solver
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Enter your puzzle and the method you wish the program to use for solving. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:
   ```
   dfs bfs or ids or ldfs?
   ```
   *Note: `ldfs` stands for limited depth search (limited DFS) and `ids` is iterative deepening search.*

   Copy and paste:
   ```
   ids
   size of grid?
   3
   enter puzzle
   1 2 3
   9 4 5
   7 8 6
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   solution:
   1 2 3
   4 9 5
   7 8 6

   1 2 3
   4 5 9
   7 8 6

   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

## Future Work
- Implement additional search algorithms like A* and Greedy Best-First Search.
- Benchmark and compare algorithm performance (if time permits).
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI). (I would be grateful if you are eager to help!)
